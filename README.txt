This is my Tic Tac Toe game, a final proejct for my CanCode Communities JavaScript Class.  

The rules are very simple.  Just hit the "play now" button and click on a cell to place an X or an O. 
The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. 
If all of the cells are filled and there is no winner, the game is a draw.

Once the game has a winnere or there is a draw the game will automatically restart.  If you want you can also 
hit the restart button anytime during gameplay.  

I put a lot of effort in the styling and the elements should resize with the viewport.  

Have fun playing!
